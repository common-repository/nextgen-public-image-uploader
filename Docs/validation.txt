Validation is currently done through a multi-step system.

! denotes a check that's not fully implemented yet. 

- Checking to make sure that the extension of the file is in the allowed list ie: JPG, BMP, PNG etc.

- Checks file size against settings, to ensure files over the set size limit are blocked. 

- Checks the file to make sure it's under the size limit defined in the options.

- Makes sure that the Mime Type of the uploaded file is an image. This also includes an on the fly
  check to make sure the extension of the file uploaded matches the true image type based on
  the mime info. For example, if the file uploaded is image.jpg, but the mime info indicates it's
  actually a gif file, this catches it and changes the extension to match what's detected. 

- Checks to make sure the file being uploaded is actually an image file. For example, if someone
  uploads an image as image.php.jpg, but it's actually a PHP file, the validation system will catch
  it and block it. It's surprising just how many image uploaders I've seen that don't do this check.

! Logs user name and uploaders IP address.
 
! Checks are done against User name and IP to ensure blacklisted Users/IPS can't upload. 
 
- makes sure that there isn't already a file with the same name in the directory it's going to. 

Only after a file passes ALL checks, does it get moved and stored in the DB.
