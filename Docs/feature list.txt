Here are all of the features currently available with the plugin:

- Thumbnail Generation. This is currently limited to JPG, GIF and PNG files, but plans
  are to add BMP and other image types. 
  
- Direct to gallery upload. For example [ngg_public_uploader gid="3"] would create an upload
  page that sends all uploads directly to gallery 3.
  
- Upload to queue. Currently, all files using [ngg_public_uploader] will go into an upload
  directory as set in the settings page, and then put into a moderation queue if the queue is enabled. 
  
- User role limits. Each role can be granted access to the upload pages, as well as the moderaiton queue.

Planned Features:

- Queue status notification. I plan on adding a Status window to the settings page on the backend,
  indicating how many files are currently awaiting moderation. 
 
- Upload notification. When uploads are processed, an optional e-mail can be sent to notify you
  that files have been uploaded.
  
- More work to be done on the thumbanil generation, adding more file types and possibly improving
  the general process. 
  
- User tagging system. Currently, the tagging system is disabled, but I plan on adding a system 
  where the moderation queue can facilitate adding image tags on the front end.
