Welcome to the setup guide for the NGG Pup image uploader plugin. 

Getting started is pretty simple. If this is your first time running 
this plugin, you will want to head into the settings page in your wordpress
admin page. Once configured to your liking, there are 3 short codes that can 
be used. 

You put these shortcodes on any page you want the function to show up
on. 

- [NGG_pup_Moderation] Will show the moderation queue page(if enabled).
The moderation queue is an optional "buffer" where you can have all uploaded
images stored until they are approved. The moderation page will show all images
currently held in the queue, and give anyone with access the ability to delete
or move all images being held. 

- [ngg_public_uploader] Will create a standalone image uploader. If the moderation
queue feature is enabled, all uploads using this will be stored in the queue. If
the moderation queue is NOT enabled, all files will just be stored in the folder
you set in the options page, and nothing more will happen with them. This does
NOT create thumbnails. 

- [ngg_public_uploader gid="x"] where x is the Gallery Id you want images uploaded
to. Using this option, all images uploaded on this page will automatically bypass
the moderation queue, and be moved to the gallery you specify. This will automatically
update NextGen gallerys database to include the files, and will also automatically
create thumbnails and place them in the appropriate folder. 

The great thing about this shortcode is, it can be used multiple times. For example,
if you have multiple galleries, you can make multiple pages with ths shortcode, each
with the GID of that gallery, and each page will upload to that gallery.
